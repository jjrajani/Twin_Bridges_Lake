        It all began a long long time ago when things were fair and there was
        nothing but a textao in ths town. Along came a man who had vision and
        dream and crossed along throught that old painted town. he stubled
        across a nice old lady who said ill here sell you this property and
        steer you this land. and so it began so started the man on clearing and
        tractoring near. until it was sure for certainly clear there was a lake
        down yonder yes assuradely there. delighted he thought how lercrose and
        verbrand lets start up a shop and bring fishers aband. then as it was
        the long journey began to what now is you see the most twin bridges of
        be.
